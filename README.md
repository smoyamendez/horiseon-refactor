## Description
---
This repository ("horiseon-refactor") is a refactored code for the Horiseon web page. The task at hand was to improve the existing code so that it follows acccessibility standards so the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines. 

The following improvements were made to the original code:

* Ensured all links were functioning correctly.
* Organized the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
* Consolidated redundant code and added comments to organize the CSS style sheet.
