# **Horiseon Code Refactor ("horiseon-seo-accesibility-hw-1")**

## The Repository
---

This repository ("horiseon-seo-accesibility-hw-1") is where we refactored the code for the Horiseon web page. An existing code was provided and modified to make it more accessible.

The following improvements were made to the original code:

* Fixed Nav Bar Broken Links.
* Organized the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
* Consolidated and added comments in the CSS style sheet.


## Mock-Up
---

The following image shows the web page's appearance.

Note: This layout is designed for "desktop" views, so some of the elements may not appear like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller that 768px.
